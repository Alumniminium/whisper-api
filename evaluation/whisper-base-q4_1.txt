 [MUSIC] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like the radio of the way People listen to the yakuya, like a wa'barri did it Grabbing is something that proves up with me I need to finish, but watch from the side Because I need a witness, so with a fall it is known that I did my business Man, and if a fall was enough, enough, and while you were outside can know If I was busy doing something, so from here I write The night it's like I never give a suit from here on out I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams, I'm never quit This is a dream, surely feel now I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself, that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting the function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great You'll never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Yeah, I will make my way to the Telet With the flat ballet, and yet this is relay A long, long cold that I have got to come to grips With I've taken so long I should just quit the bitch There was no one else I'm blame by myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help, help, help Help me as all I see them speak So I just called the quits when they turn the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me without the light The light inside is right in front of me and seen by my insight Cause my insight was open eyes lets me know that I'll be alright Alright, alright so maybe I've begun to pick my feet up Hold up, hold up, I need a speed up just like a cheetah Hear my pair of high-prefuges, time to burn the foam of feces The choice I choose must never be in that computer I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Someday I will contribute to society Someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy, finally I'll be gun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making the break up from sleep I'm on my grind like a big beard black Synth against paper my brain is something I'll never tack with I swear to myself that I'm on my way to fame I swear on everything, even my J-Hot Nameless is for honor Gus, where are you vetting down the clock? The day that I could wrap in is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finished this bout You can go ahead and make your way to 10 But you better let 'em know that I rise before the n-8 I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
