 [Music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like the radio of the way People listen to the echo, I like it, I barely did it Clapin' it something that proves up with me, I need to finish But watch from the side, because I need a witness So with a fall it is known that I did my business Man, and if a fall it wasn't off enough, and nothing While you were out, I was busy doing something So from here I write, 'til you're not yet It's like I never give a suit from here on out I'm about seeing your lyrics in my dreams I'm never quit This is a dream, surely feen, now I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting a function I promise to myself that I will be to once so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Yeah, I will make my way to the Telet With the flat ballet and yet this is relay A long, long code that I have got to come to grips with I've taken so long I should just quit the bitch There was no one else in blame but myself 'Cause I was always here whenever I needed help, help, help Help me as all I see would speak So I just called the quits when they turn the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me Without the light, the light inside is right in front of me It seemed by my insight 'cause my insight was open And I just let me know that it'll be all right All right, all right so maybe I begun to pick my feet up Hold up, hold up, I need to speed up Just like a cheetah, hear my pair of hyperfutures Time to burn up all my feuses The choice I choose must never be in that computer I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Someday I'll contribute to society And someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy Finally I begun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break out from sleep I'm on my grind like a big beer blacksmith Against paper my brain is something I'll not attack with I swear to myself that I'm on my way to fame I swear on everything even my j-hoc nameless is for honor Gus where are you betting on the clock The daily back what wrapping is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finished this bout You can go ahead and make your way to 10 But you better let them know that I rise before then Hey I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
