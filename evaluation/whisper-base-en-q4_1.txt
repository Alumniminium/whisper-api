 [Music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like the radio of the way People listen to the echo I like it while barely did it Wapping to something that proves up with me I need to finish But watch from the side because I need a witness So if I fall it is known that I did my business Man and if I fall it wasn't nothing While you were out slack and off I was busy doing something So from here I write day and night It's like I never get no sleep from here on out I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams I'm never quit This is a dream surely, feeling how I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting a function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Yeah I will make my way to the telly With a flat ballet And yet this was Ralay A long long cold that I have got to come to grips With I'm takin' so long I should just quit the bitchen There was no one else I blame by myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help Help, help, help me as all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turn the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me Without the light and light inside is right in front of me It seemed by my inside cause my inside was open I'd let me know that I'll be alright I'll ride alright so maybe I begun to pick my feet up Pulled up a lump and I need a speed up Just like a cheetah Me and my pair of high profuses Time to burn up all my fuses A choice I choose will never be in any commuses I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Someday I will be on the TV screen Someday I will contribute to society Someday I will get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy finally I'll be gunna begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break I promise me I'm on my grind like a big beard blacksmith against paper My brain is something I'm now attack with I swear to myself that I'll hunt my way to fame I swear on everything Even my Jayhawk name is his for honor Guz Glory and betting down the clock The daily back what rapping is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it till the end that I finish this bout You can go ahead and make your way to ten But you better let 'em know that I'll rise before then, eh? I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
