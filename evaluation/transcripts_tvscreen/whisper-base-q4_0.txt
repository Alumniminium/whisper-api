 [music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like they're right no other way People listen to the Yakko-I-Lakko, I barely did it Laughing is something that proves up with me I need to finish for watching the side Because I need a witness So with a fall it is known that I did my business Man and if a fall it wasn't off enough And while you were outside can know I was busy doing something So from here I write, 'till you're not yet It's like I never get no sleep from here on out I'm about seeing the lyrics in my dreams I'll never quit This is a dream, surely fee now I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting the function I promise to myself that I will be To once so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Yeah, I will make my way to the telli With the flat ballet and yet this is relay A long long call that I have got to come to grips with I've taken so long I should just quit the bitch There was no one else I'm raving myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help help help help help help help help me as all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turn the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me without the light The light inside is right in front of me And seen by my insikers my insikers open eyes Let me know that I'll be alright, alright alright So maybe I be gone and pick my feet up Pulled up up up I need a speed up just like a cheetah Need my pair of high perfusies Time to burn the foam up users The choice I choose was never be in any confusies I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was all me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was all me Someday I will be on the TV screen Someday I'll contribute your society And someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy Finally I'll be gun to be in the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making the break out from the seat I'm on my grind like a big beer Blacksmith again Some paper my brain is something I'm not what I act with I swear to myself that I'm on my way to fame I swear on everything, even my J-Hop name is just for honor Yes, where are you vetting round the clock? The daily back what rapping is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finished this bout You can go ahead and make your way to 10 But you better let 'em know that I'll rise before men 8 I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was all me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was all me Someday I will be on the TV screen (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (music) (upbeat music)
