People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like there ain't no other way People listen to the echo, I like how I barely did it Craping is something to prove so please move I need it finished But watch from the side because I need a witness So if I fall it is known that I did my business Man and if I fall it wasn't off and nothing while you were out psyching off I was busy doing something so from here I write Till you're not get psyched I never get no sleep from here on out I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams I'll never quit This is a dream surely female I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will begin to function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great You'll never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Yeah I will make my way to the tele with the flat ballet And yet this is relay A long long cold that I have got to come to grips with I'm taking so long I should just quit the bitch in There is no one else I'm blaming myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help Help help help me is all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turned the other cheek I've basically been a basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me without the light The light inside is right in front of me it seemed by my insight Cause my insightful so bananas lets me know that I'll be alright Alright alright so maybe I've begun to pick my feet up Hold up hold up I need to speed up Just like a cheater Need my pair of hyperfuels it's time to burn up all my fuses The choice I choose must never be in a confused I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Someday I'll contribute to society And someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy finally I begun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break I promisely I'm on my grind like a big beard blacksmith Against paper my brain is something I'll now attack with I swear to myself that I'll hunt my way to fame I swear on everything even my j-hop name This is for honor, guts, glory I'm betting 9 o'clock that daily back what rapping is The day my breath stops so if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it till the end that I finished this bout You can go ahead and make your way to 10 But you better let 'em know that I'll rise before then Ay I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen {END} Wait Time : 0.00 sec Model Load: 0.36 sec Decoding : 0.63 sec Transcribe: 148.09 sec Total Time: 149.08 sec
