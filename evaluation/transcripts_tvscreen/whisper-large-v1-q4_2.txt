*music* People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like there ain't no other way People listen to the echo I let go I barely did it Rapping is something to prove so please move I need it finished But watch from the side because I need a witness So if I fall it is known that I did my business Man and if I fall it wasn't often nothing while you were out slacking off I was busy doing something so from here I write Day and night it's like I never get no sleep From here on out I'm about Seeing lyrics in my dreams I'll never quit This is a dream surely fee now I believe I will achieve As long as I can take the heat I promised to myself that I will work on my production I promised to myself that I will be getting to function I promised to myself that I will be someone so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Yeah I will make my way to the telly With a flat ballet and yet this is relay A long long cold that I have got to come to grips with I've taken so long I should just quit the bitchin' There is no one else I'm blaming myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help Help, help, help me is all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turn the other cheek I've basically been a basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me without the light The light inside is right in front of me it's seen by my insight Cause my insight puts open eyes lets me know that I'll be alright Alright alright so maybe I've begun to pick my feet up Hold up hold up I need to speed up just like a cheetah Need my pair of hyperfuses time to burn up all my fuses The choice I choose must never be a naked muses I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Someday I'll contribute to society And someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind has no privacy finally I've begun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break I promise thee I'm on my grind like a big beard blacksmith against paper My brain is something I'll now attack with I swear to myself that I'll hunt my way to fame I swear on everything even my j-hawk name This is for honor, guts, glory I'm betting round the clock The day that I quit rapping is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finish this bout You can go ahead and make your way to ten But you better let 'em know that I'll rise before then I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen *Music* {END} Wait Time : 0.00 sec Model Load: 1.55 sec Decoding : 0.57 sec Transcribe: 953.79 sec Total Time: 955.90 sec
