 [Music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like the radio of the way People listen to the echo I like it while I barely did it Wrapping to something that proves up with me I need to finish But watch from the side because I need a witness So with a fall it is known that I did my business Man and if a fall it wasn't off and nothing while you were out Slacking off, I was busy doing something so from here I write Say it now, it's like I never get no sleep from here on out I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams I'm never quit This is a dream surely female I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting a function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will make my way to the telly with a flat ballet and yet this is relay A long long cold that I have got to come to grips with I'm taking so long I should just quit the bitches There was no one else I'm blaming myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help Help, help, help me is all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turned the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me without the light The light inside is right in front of me and seen by my insight Cause my insightful soap and eyes lets me know that I'll be alright I'll ride alright so maybe I begun to pick my feet up Pulled up, pulled up, I need a speed up just like a cheetah Need my pair of high-perfuses time to burn up all my fuses The choice I choose must never be in any commuses I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Someday I'll contribute to society And someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy finally I begun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break I promise I'm on my grind like a big beard blacksmith against paper My brain is something I'm now attack with I swear to myself that I'll hunt my way to fame I swear on everything even my Jayhawk name is just for honor Yes, worry I'm betting down the clock that they leave I quit rapping is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see you to the end that I finish this bout You can go ahead and make your way to ten But you better let 'em know that I'll rise before then, eh I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
