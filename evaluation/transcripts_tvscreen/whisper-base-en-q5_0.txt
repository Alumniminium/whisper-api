 [Music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like the radio of the way People listen to the echo I like it while I barely did it Wrapping to something that proves up with me I need to finish But watch from the side because I need a witness So with a fall it is known that I did my business Man and if a fall it wasn't off and nothing While you were out slack and I'm if I was busy doing something So from here I write to your night it's like I never get no sleep From here on out I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams I'm never quit this is a dream surely Fearly, fear now I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting a function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Yeah I will make my way to the telly With a flat ballet And yet this was Rile, a long long cold That I have got to come to grips with I'm taking so long I should just quit the bitching There was no one else I blame about myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help Help, help, help me is all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turned the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me Without the light inside is right in front of me It seemed by my insight cause my insight was open As I let me know that I'll be alright I'll ride alright so maybe I begun to pick my feet up Pulled up, pulled up, I needed speed up Just like a cheetah, me my pair of high profuses Time to burn up all my fuses The choice I choose must never be in any commuses I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Sunday I'll contribute to society And some day will get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy finally I begun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break I promise me, I'm on my grind Like a big beard blacksmith against paper My brain is something I'm now attack with I swear to myself that I'll hunt my way to fame I swear on everything, even my Jayhawk name is just for honor Yes, glory I'm betting down the clock The daily back what rapping is the day My breath stops so If I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finish this bout You can go ahead and make your way to ten But you better let 'em know that I rise before then I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
