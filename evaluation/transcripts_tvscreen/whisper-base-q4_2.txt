 [music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like the radio of the way People listen to the echo I like it while barely did it clapping and something to prove so much move I need to finish but watch from the side because I need awareness so with a fall it is known that I did my business man and if a fall it wasn't nothing while you were out cycling off I was busy doing something so from here I write to you and I get tired I can never get this suit from here on out I'm about seeing the lyrics in my dreams I'm never quit this is a dream surely fee now I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself to I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting the function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me someday I will be on the TV screen yeah I will make my way to the Telle with the flat ballet and yet this is relay a long long cold that I have got to come to grips with I've taken so long I should just quit the bitch and there was no one else I'm blame by myself because I was always here whenever I needed help help help help help help help me as all I seem to speak so I just called the quits when they turn the other cheek I basically bend the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me without the light the light inside is right in front of me it seemed by my insiders my insiders open eyes let's me know that I'll be alright I'll ride alright so maybe I've begun to pick my feet up hold up up I need to speed up just like a cheetah need my pair of high-previews just time to burn up all my fevers the choice I choose was never be in that confuses I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me someday I will be on the TV screen someday I will contribute to society and someday we'll get past the advisory my mind is like a bunch of written binary my mind is no privacy finally I begun to be in the writing ironically the darkness seems to follow me but this time around I'm making the break I promise to you I'm on my grind like a big beer black Smith again some paper my brain is something I know I will tack with I swear myself that I'm on my way to fame I swear on everything even my j-hoc nameless is for honor yes where are you betting nine o'clock the daily I could wrap in is the day my breath stops so if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finish this bout you can go ahead and make you late at 10 but you better let them know that I rise before then a I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me someday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
