 [Music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like a radio of the way People listen to the echo I like it while I barely did it Graping to something to prove something to prove so blue I need to finish But watch from the side because I need a witness So if I fall it is known that I did my business Man and if I fall it wasn't nothing while you around So I can not if I was busy doing something so from here I write Say it not get's like I never get no sleep from here on out I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams I'm never quit This is a dream surely female I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting a function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Yeah I will make my way to the tell a With a flat ballet and yet this is really a long long Cold that I have got to come to grips with I'm taking so long I should just quit the bitches There was no one else in blame of myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help Help, help, help me is all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turned the other cheek I basically been the basic fish my entire life I've got a route awakening for me without the light The light inside is right in front of me It seemed by my insight cause my insight was open I just let me know that I'll be alright I'll ride alright so maybe I begun to pick my feet up Pulled up a love I need to speed up just like a cheetah Me and my pair of hyperfuses Time to burn up all my fuses The choice I choose was never being a compucius I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen Someday I'll contribute to society And someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy finally I begun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break I promise I'm on my grind like a big beard blacksmith against paper My brain is something I'm now attack with I swear to myself that I'm on my way to fame I swear on everything even my Jayhawk name This is for honor Just worry I'm betting on the clock The daily banquet rapin' is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see you to the end that I finish this bout You can go ahead and make your way to ten But you better let 'em know that I'll rise before then, eh? I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Sunday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
