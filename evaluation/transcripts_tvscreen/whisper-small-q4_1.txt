People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like there ain't no other way People listen to the echo I let go I barely did it Wrapping it's something that proofs up with me I need to finish But watch from the side because I need a witness So if I fall it is known that I did my business Man and if I fall it wasn't off enough And while you were outside I could not If I was busy doing something so from here I write Day and night it's like I never get no sleep From here on out I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams I'll never quit this is a dream Shirley Fee Now I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting a function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Yeah I will make my way to the tele With a flat belay and yet this is relay A long long cold that I have got to come to grips With I've taken so long I should just quit the bitchin' There was no one else in my way but myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help Help help help me is all I seem to speak So I just called the quits when they turned the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awake and been waiting for me without the light The light inside is right in front of me it seemed by my insight Cause my insight will soap and as us we know that I'll be alright So maybe I've begun to pick my feet up Hold up hold up I need a speed up just like a cheetah Need my pair of hyperfuses time to burn up all my fuses The choice I choose must never be an a-conviusess I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Someday I'll contribute to society Someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy finally I've begun to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break I promise you I'm on my grind like a big beard blacksmith against paper My brain is something I'll now attack with I swear to myself that I'm on my way to fame I swear on everything even my J-Hawk name A-conviusess for honor, guts, glory, and betting round the clock The day that I quit rapping is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finish this bout You can go ahead and make your way to ten But you better let them know that I'll rise before then Ayy! I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen {END} Wait Time : 0.00 sec Model Load: 0.43 sec Decoding : 0.59 sec Transcribe: 141.45 sec Total Time: 142.47 sec
