 [Music] People look at their past just like it happened yesterday I try to see tomorrow like the radio of the way People listen to the echo, I like it while barely did it Clapin' it something that proves up with me, I need to finish But watch from the side because I need a witness So with a fall it is known that I did my business Man and if a fall it wasn't off enough, then walk you around S like it not, if I was busy doing something So from here I write, say you're not, it's like I never give a suit From here on out, I'm about seeing lyrics in my dreams I'm never quit, this is a dream, surely feel now I believe I will achieve as long as I can take the heat I promise to myself that I will work on my production I promise to myself that I will be getting the function I promise to myself that I will be someone so great Y'all will never forget me I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Yeah, I will make my way to the Telet With the flat ballet and yet this is relay A long, long comb that I have got to come to grips With I've taken so long I should just quit the bitch There was no one else I'm blame but myself Cause I was always here whenever I needed help, help, help Help me as all I see was speak So I just called the quits when they turn the other cheek I basically been the basic bitch my entire life I've got a rude awakening waiting for me Without the light the light inside is right in front of me And seen by my insight, cause my insight was open And I just let's me know that I'll be alright Alright, alright so maybe I began to pick my feet up Hold up, hold up, I need to speed up Just like a cheetah, hear my pair of high perfumes Just time to burn up all my feuses The choice I choose must never be in that computer I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen Someday I will contribute to society Someday we'll get past the advisory My mind is like a bunch of written binary My mind is no privacy Finally I'll be gunned to begin the rioting Ironically the darkness seems to follow me But this time around I'm making a break out from sleep I'm on my grind like a big beard black Smit the gents and paper my brain is something I'll never attack with I swear to myself that I'll hunt my way to fame I swear on everything, even my j-hawk name is just for honor Guests, where are you betting on the clock? The daily back what wrapping is the day my breath stops So if I fall to the mat, I hope you never count me out I will see it to the end that I finished this bout You can go ahead and make your way to 10 But you better let 'em know that I rise before then Hey, I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen I will climb to the top eventually I will be someone that you can someday see I will never forget that this was on me Someday I will be on the TV screen [Music]
